## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at First ADE. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should **never** be reported via public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately

Please report vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab of the affected repository
- **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainers (check the repository's README for contact information)

### 3. What to Include

Your report should include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### 5. Disclosure Policy

- We follow **coordinated disclosure** practices
- We will credit reporters in security advisories (unless anonymity is requested)
- Please allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

All First ADE projects should:

- Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
- Use branch protection rules on `main`
- Require signed commits for sensitive repositories
- Run security scanning in CI pipelines
